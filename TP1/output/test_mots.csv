1323,how about no more bills since there are way too many laws to keep track too much money being spent and too much government intervention in our daily lives already
1324,please convince trudeau to scrap this or at the very least let the public know what is in it and have some say
1325,too many overriding powers given to international conglomerates at the expense of the citizens of canada even from the little bit i have heard
