4608,even a shattered dream can do that for you

7174,what a joy she will be to your family
7175,getting the diagnosis that i did yesterday the thought that the gop is still on this subject blows my mind

7262,so perhaps we should start by ending the firing of hard working americans from the military simply for being gay
7263,good morning from okinawa japan
7264,please explain to your cohost that being consistently moronic is not a quality we the american people require in a president
7265,a little too much too fast
7266,he is not my president
7267,with that said we shall wait and see just how much clout and pushing congress around he has and does
7268,jill and those that enjoyed this video will most likely appreciate the urantia book
7269,this is true especially if they grasped her closing remarks
7270,brother in faith jj
7271,no prob thanks for the props
7272,filled with factual errors and what can only be intentional distortions and turning a blind eye
7273,what a biased presentation
7274,i expected more from ted
7275,a fascinating use of anthropology as part of conceptual art
7276,with the added layer of technology this talk gets very close to the core of the human centered approach we all love so much about ted
7277,i wonder how we could make it easier for people to share their stories in such a compelling way
7278,i did my happy dance in the rain your rain of props of course
7279,awesome thank you
7280,prop bombs rock as do you for giving said prop bomb the compliment is noted glad you approve of my new pic d
7281,i found the best and most entertaining response is the uninitiated dirty talk confuddling them and leading in general to even more random rage
7282,fantastic insight
7283,inspiration ideas
7284,i'll be sharing this with my students age 70 this semester
7285,putting them in literally the same spot is stupid
7286,setting them all up to be able to hit the same target then forcing fights in that spot is generally the best way to make use of them
7287,randomly doing one second worth of one turrets damage to an un engaged enemy is stupid
7288,wonderful news
7289,see you sunday
7290,common sense a generous heart and enough love for this beautiful state wonderful country precious planet and all it's inhabitants to speak up and fight for all that we need to protect prosper and plan for the future
7291,thank you tom
7292,happy birthday
7293,i had a similar experience to julia's after 12 years of searching for a god i could believe in i find that i am comfortable as an agnostic atheist
7294,humm
7295,i wonder why
7296,must be of benefit to them some how since drugs are illegal even though they have existed way before any of us
7297,so no one is guilty for that
7298,stephen you stand head and shoulders above the rest and you will always have our vote and gratitude for everything you do
7299,from a proud postal worker
7300,i was approved to review it through netgalley then they archived it before i downloaded it
7301,time to check my library so bummed
7302,except if youre from america dont say fancy
7303,the average graduate in ghana has a sense of entitlement rather than a sense of responsibility how true and how that must change
7304,good one patrick awuah
7305,thanks for the follow back and props
7306,very much appreciated
7307,a picture is worth one thousand words
7308,this is what you all are doing to the taxpayers
7309,https www facebook com percy wolf posts 10207395535720149 we are taxed enough
7310,this is what the average taxpayers refrig looks like
7311,let's see yours
7312,i stopped the video when she said my project is about art specifically about black artists
7313,if a white guy said my project is about art specifically about white artists he would be racist
7314,this is exactly what's wrong with architecture
7315,rather than designing buildings for people to live in they're trying to tell a story
7316,ten years down the road the story they wind up telling is this we sacrificed livability in order to make a trite statement
7317,good evening rock the percent over power cell miracle for marvel entertainment corp worldclub is really help more significant flim coming over with your presentable ambled
7318,thank you
7319,no worries man you as well

7325,you appear to be doing it right sir
7326,appreciate the follow
7327,i 100 agree nicholas robb
7328,her and her agenda have nothing to do with what's good for us
7329,she can take her form letter responses and shove it
7330,such an attemp is really remarkable showing us things which we may never have the chance to get to see them in person
7331,this is a total ted talk
7332,thanks for sharing it

8099,ugh that sounds awful feel better
8100,hmm i believe they go hand in hand
8101,in order to land the combo you need to place w in a correct spot considering jukes etc and then aim e to pull the hero in

10465,love it
10466,i am sharing on the education now
10467,facebook page my own wall and on google
10468,thank you
10469,the artistic and educational value of this technology is interesting i would however much like to see some more practical applications
10470,is it even viable to have old school circuits replaced by ink and paper
10471,what is the durability of such circuits
10472,when i started eating like food was going out of style lol
10473,eat eat eat
10474,i mean its true though

10497,as storytelling its okay and maybe even better prosey imho
10498,you have a point there
10499,assuming they ever freaking find someone
10500,at this point it is pretty safe to say that this is a failed product
10501,perhaps it's also a classic case of some very cool technology which has been inappropriately implemented
10502,i don't buy arguments which essentially assert that it both creates and solves its own need
10503,except most of the races have been great this season

13823,only question is does america have sufficient clarity of thought the moral values and the strength to implement your vision
13824,so should we use sun cream next time we are laying down on a beach
13825,or there will be a new waterproof breathable cream blocking cancer but absorbing certain type of uv to fight with heart problems

15267,a woman friend of mine once told me she thought it was because japanese and also korean women represent the feminine ideal in both their physical features and supposed demure and obedient behavior

15489,some people have crazy ideas
15490,the words from a man whom i think seriously meant that
15491,it would go to show he was a true professional in control of all that he could control in this sport that pushes the boundaries
15492,they are all dirty and should be held accountable no matter what alligiances they have with politicians
15493,my mother's premium just went up again the second time in 8 mos
